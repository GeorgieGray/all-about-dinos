                If you stepped outside 20,000 years ago, you’d probably need a winter coat, even in summer. That’s
                because Earth was experiencing an ice age—a time when sheets of ice covered large parts of North
                America, Europe, and Asia. It was also a time when humans lived alongside a now-extinct group of
                elephants called mammoths.
            </p>
            </p>
            <h2 class="info-heading">Ancient elephant</h2>
            <p class="info">
                One species, called woolly mammoths, roamed the cold tundra of Europe, Asia, and North America from
                about 300,000 years ago up until about 10,000 years ago. (But the last known group of woolly mammoths
                survived until about 1650 B.C.—that’s over a thousand years after the Pyramids at Giza were built!)
            </p>
            <p class="info">
                These animals grazed on plants, using their 15-foot-long tusks to dig under snow for food like shrubs
                and grasses. Like today’s elephants, woolly mammoths likely gave birth to one calf at a time, and the
                females and their young roamed in herds of about 15 individuals. Male mammoths would leave the herd at
                about age 10.
            </p>


            <h2 class="info-heading">Snow ready</h2>
            <p class="info">
                Woolly mammoths were probably about the size of African elephants, around 13 feet tall. But woolly
                mammoths had much smaller ears, which kept them from losing body heat. They were also covered in two
                layers of fur—the shaggy outer layer could be 20 inches long and helped them stay toasty in temperatures
                as low as minus 58°F. Woolly mammoths also had a lump on their back, which scientists think were fat
                stores that provided energy when food was scarce, sort of like a camel’s hump.
            </p>
            <class="info">
                Scientists aren’t sure exactly why woolly mammoths went extinct: Some think that humans hunted too many
                of them, and others believe that they couldn’t survive Earth’s naturally warming climate. Or, it
                could’ve been a combination of both.
