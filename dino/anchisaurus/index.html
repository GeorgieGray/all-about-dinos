                Anchisaurus is a small basal sauropodomorph dinosaur that lived during the Early Jurassic period in the
                Portland Formation, in what are now Connecticut and Massachusetts.

            <h2 class="info-heading heading-small"> Small But Mighty</h2>
            <p class="info">
                It was a rather diminutive dinosaur, up to 2 metres long and weighed 27 kilograms. However, a larger
                species, Ammosaurus major was found in the same formation, it was estimated to be up to 2.5 to 4 metres
                (8 ft 2 in to 13 ft 1 in) long and 32 kilograms (70 lbs). Ammosaurus is now viewed to be a junior
                synonym of Anchisaurus.
            </p>
            <p class="info">
                Sauropodomorph remains were first documented in North America in 1818, when some bones were uncovered by
                Mr. Solomon Ellsworth Jr. while excavating a well with gunpowder in East Windsor, Connecticut. At the
                time of their discovery it was thought that the bones might be those of a human, but the presence of
                tail vertebrae falsified that idea. They are now recognized as those of an indeterminate sauropodomorph

            <p class="info">
                Digesting plant matter is a much more intensive biochemical process than digesting meat. This herbivore
                swallowed gastroliths (gizzard stones) to help break down the food in its stomach. Herbivorous dinosaurs
                needed a huge gut. Since this had to be positioned in front of the pelvis, balancing on two legs became
                increasingly difficult, as dinosaurs became larger and they gradually evolved into the quadrupedal
                position that characterizes the later sauropods such as Diplodocus.
