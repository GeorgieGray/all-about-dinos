                A herd of dinosaurs with fancy crests on their heads graze along a shoreline in what’s now western North
                America about 75 million years ago. Suddenly, one of the animals—called a Parasaurolophus—stands up on
                its two hind feet, lifts its head, and takes a big gulp of air. Then it releases a honking alarm call
                that sounds sort of like an elephant trumpeting. The other Parasaurolophus dinosaurs understand the
                message—a predator is nearby.

            <p class="info">
                Scientists made the discovery by examining the tubelike holes inside the crest. One paleontologist
                created a replica using plastic pipes he could blow into—and out came a trumpetlike B-flat note.
                Scientists still aren’t sure if Parasaurolophus used its sounds for defense, attracting mates,
                communicating with the herd, or all of these.

            <p class="info">
                This dino grew to be about 33 feet from snout to tail, and its crested skull was over five feet long.
                That curved, bony crest puzzled scientists in the past: Some thought it might be a super sniffer, or
                something like a snorkel to breathe while underwater. Turns out, the crest was a noisemaker.
            </p>
            <p class="info">
                This dinosaur had flight feathers on both its front and back limbs, and it had long upper arm bones
                similar to those seen in today’s birds. It also had a fan of feathers on its tail that it might have
                used to steer as it coasted to the ground. Scientists have discovered that its feathers were iridescent,
                meaning they had a metallic shine similar to the feathers of modern peacocks and hummingbirds.

            </p>

            <h2 class="info-heading">Not-quite-right name</h2>
            <p class="info">
                This dino’s name means “like Saurolophus,” which is another crested dinosaur. (Saurolophus means “lizard
                crest.”) But it turns out these two aren’t that similar: Saurolophus’s headgear was solid;
                Parasaurolophus’s crest was hollow. So experts believe they used them for different reasons.
            </p>
            <p class="info">
                However, both animals are part of a group of herbivorous (or plant-eating) dinosaurs called duckbills
                because of the flat shape of their mouth bones. But that’s also not exactly right: These animals had
                shovel-shaped beaks—not bills—for snipping off pieces of tough plants like evergreens and ferns. They
                also had teeth in their cheeks chewing and grinding the plant matter.
