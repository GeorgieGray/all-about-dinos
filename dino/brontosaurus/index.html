            <p class="info">
                Brontosaurus was a large, long-necked quadrupedal animal with a long, whip-like tail, and forelimbs that
                were slightly shorter than their hindlimbs. The largest of the species weighed up to 15 tonnes (15 long
                tons; 17 short tons) and measured up to 22 m (72 ft) long from head to tail.

            </p>
            <h2 class="info-heading heading-small">Where's your head at?</h2>
            <p class="info">
                The skull of Brontosaurus has not been found, but was probably similar to the skull of the closely
                related Apatosaurus. Like those of other sauropods, the vertebrae of the neck were deeply bifurcated;
                that is, they carried paired spines, resulting in a wide and deep neck. The vertebral formula was: 15
                cervicals, 10 dorsals, five sacrals, and 82 caudals. The caudal vertebra number was noted to vary, even
                within a species. The cervical vertebrae were stouter than other diplodocids, though not as stout as in
                mature specimens of Apatosaurus


            </p>
            <h2 class="info-heading heading-small">The neck of you!</h2>
            <p class="info">
                The large neck was filled with an extensive system of weight-saving air sacs. Brontosaurus, like its
                close relative Apatosaurus, had tall spines on its vertebrae, which make up more than half the height of
                the individual bones. The shape of the tail was unusual for diplodocids, being comparatively slender,
                due to the vertebral spines rapidly decreasing in height the farther they are from the hips
            </p>

            <p class="info">
                Historically, sauropods like Brontosaurus were believed to be too massive to support their own weight on
                dry land, so theoretically they must have lived partly submerged in water, perhaps in swamps. Recent
                findings do not support this, and sauropods are thought to have been fully terrestrial animals.>
