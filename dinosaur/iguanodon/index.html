          An Iguanodon stands on its powerful hind legs and reaches for a
          flowering plant—something new on Earth at the time, around 130 million
          years ago. The dino uses its hands to pull the plant closer to its
          beak. Its mouth is full of curved and grooved teeth for grinding
          plants, and its jaws can move both up and down and side to side as it
          eats. The dinosaur takes a tasty bite.
        </p>
        <h2 class="info-heading heading-small">New creature</h2>
        <p class="info">
          Iguanodon was one of the first dinosaurs described by scientists after
          its fossilized tooth was found in southeast England in 1822. (The word
          “dinosaur” wasn’t even used until 1842.) People had been finding
          dinosaur fossils for thousands of years, but they didn’t know what
          they were. So when a paleontologist saw the fossil, he first thought
          it was the tooth of an extinct giant iguana and named the animal
          Iguanodon, meaning—of course—“iguana tooth.” Little by little,
          scientists began to understand that Iguanodon wasn’t an iguana but a
          whole new type of animal, one that didn’t exist anymore. In fact, this
          animal lived between 130 and 110 million years ago in what’s now
          Europe.
        </p>
        <p class="info">
          It was about the same height as an African elephant but weighed twice
          as much, so Iguanodon needed strong leg bones to support its bulk.
          Scientists think the dino could walk either on two feet or all
          fours—unique for dinosaurs. On its hind legs, Iguanodon had three
          short, thick toes that were probably padded to cushion its feet from
          its massive weight.

        <h2 class="info-heading heading-small">Thumb request</h2>
        <p class="info">
          When paleontologists went back to the spot where the fossilized tooth
          was found, they discovered more fossilized bones, including one that
          looked like a horn. Scientists first mistakenly put the object on
          Iguanodon’s head like a rhinoceros. But later, experts realized it was
          actually a spiky thumb that belonged on the dino’s hand. Iguanodon
          might’ve used the digit to defend itself or dig into fruits and seeds.
