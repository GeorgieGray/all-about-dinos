        <p class="info">
          A hungry Allosaurus runs up to Stegosaurus, ready to attack. But as it
          gets close, Stegosaurus swings its heavy tail, and—whack! One of its
          thick, pointy spikes drives into Allosaurus’ tailbone. Allosaurus
          limps away, and Stegosaurus continues to munch ferns and young trees.
        </p>
        <h2 class="info-heading heading-small">Puzzling plates</h2>
        <p class="info">
          Stegosaurus is famous for its two rows of kite-shaped plates that
          stick out from its neck, back, and tail. But the paleontologist who
          first discovered a Stegosaurus fossil thought the plates laid flat on
          its back like a turtle’s shell. That’s why its name in Greek means
          “roof lizard.”
        </p>
        <p class="info">
          So why does Stegosaurus have these plates? Some scientists think they
          were used to attract mates, similar to the frill on a Triceratops.
          Others think the plates protected Stegosaurus from attacking predators
          or absorbed heat from the sun to help warm the animal. Although the
          plates are still a mystery, fossilized footprints reveal that this
          dino likely traveled in family groups.
        </p>
        <p class="info">
          Experts think that Stegosaurus’s tail was its main method of defense.
          The dino could swing its large tail from side to side with great
          force. A fossilized tailbone of Allosaurus has a hole in it the size
          of a Stegosaurus tail spike—ouch!
        </p>
        <h2 class="info-heading heading-small">Butt brain?</h2>
        <p class="info">
          Stegosaurus lived about 145 million years ago during the Jurassic
          period in what’s now Colorado, Utah, and Wyoming. It was about the
          length of a bus and weighed almost 14,000 pounds. But this enormous
          animal had a brain that was only slightly larger than a walnut.
        </p>
        <p class="info">
          One early paleontologist believed that Stegosaurus had a second brain
          in its tail because the expert noticed a cavity like those where the
          brain would be in its rump. But that’s a busted myth—the empty space
          likely held a mass of tissue that might have helped produce extra
          energy or was simply a fluid-filled gland.
